When running the `FindSamplesAndBenchmark` wdl with many samples, it sometimes happens that a few fail in Terra while most succeed. Unfortunately, this means that the outputs of benchmarking the successful ones don't get compiled into one convenient .csv file to use for data analysis. If you don't mind sacrificing the few that failed, or want to get started analyzing the successful ones ASAP, this wdl will automatically collect the successful outputs and aggregate them into one .csv, similar to the last task of the benchmarking wdl. Simply input the workspace bucket name (found in the Dashboard) and the submission ID for the `FindSamplesAndBenchmark` wdl with the partially successful outputs. This should work regardless of whether the task was run on multiple samples or a sample set object in Terra.
